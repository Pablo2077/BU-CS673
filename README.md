Assignment1:
  1. HelloWorld：Write a program that prints ‘Hello World’ to the screen
  2. MultiplicationTable: Write a program that prints a multiplication table for numbers up to 12
  3. PalindromeCheck: Write a function that tests whether a string is a palindrome and test it in your program
  4. CombineLists: Write a function that combines two lists by alternatingly taking elements, e.g. [a,b,c], [1,2,3] → [a,1,b,2,c,3] and test it in your program
  5. FibonacciNumbers: Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. The first two Fibonacci numbers are 1 and 1. 
      The n+1-st Fibonacci number can be computed by adding the n-th and the n-1-th Fibonacci number. 
      The first few are therefore 1, 1, 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+5=8. Test it in your program.
  6.LeapYearCheck: Write a function that determines if a given year is a leap year. Test it in your program.
